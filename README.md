# CoreTempAI Project

A physics-based machine learning framework for predicting core body temperature using advanced neural architectures and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data.

## Overview

CoreTempAI combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with physics-based simulations to provide accurate predictions of core body temperature. The project leverages both traditional neural networks and advanced transformer-based architectures (DiFormer) to process various input parameters including both scalar values and temporal profiles.
